# Smart Irrigation System  
### Predictive & Rain-Aware Irrigation with Water Usage Analytics

## 📌 Overview
This project presents an intelligent Arduino-based Smart Irrigation System that goes beyond basic automation. Unlike conventional systems that rely only on fixed moisture thresholds, this solution predicts soil dryness, avoids irrigation during rainfall, and tracks water usage to enable sustainable and data-driven irrigation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate irrigation based on soil moisture conditions
- Predict soil dryness using moisture trend analysis
- Prevent irrigation during rainfall conditions
- Quantify water usage for sustainable farming
- Reduce water wastage and improve irrigation efficiency

---

## ⚙️ System Working
1. A soil moisture sensor continuously measures soil conditions.
2. The system stores current and previous moisture values.
3. If soil moisture drops rapidly, irrigation is triggered **predictively**, even before critical dryness.
4. If soil moisture crosses a predefined dry threshold, irrigation is activated.
5. A rain-aware mode disables irrigation completely during rainfall.
6. Pump ON duration is tracked and converted into approximate water usage.
7. System status and water usage information are displayed on the LCD.

## 🏆 Innovation & Advanced Features

### 🌟 Predictive Irrigation
The system analyzes the **rate of moisture drop** instead of reacting only after the soil becomes dry. This allows early irrigation, improving crop health and efficiency.

> This shifts irrigation control from reactive to predictive decision-making.

---

### 🌧️ Rain-Aware Irrigation Control
A rain mode input disables the pump during rainfall conditions, preventing unnecessary irrigation.

> This demonstrates real-world awareness and intelligent resource conservation.

---

### 💧 Water Usage Analytics
The system tracks pump operation time and estimates the total water consumed in liters.

> Making water conservation measurable rather than theoretical.
